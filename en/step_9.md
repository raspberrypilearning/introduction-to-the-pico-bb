## RGB LEDs

RGB LEDs produce a range of colours by combining Red(R), Green(G) and Blue(B) light. 

RGB LEDs have 4 legs rather than two. Our projects **common cathode** RGB LEDs which means one leg needs connecting to a **GND** pin and the other three legs need connecting to **GPIO** pins.

There are also common anode RGBLEDs, which means that one leg needs connecting to a **3.3V** pin, and the other legs need connecting to **GPIO** pins.

With either type of RGB LED, a resistor is needed for each pin that is connected to a **GPIO** pin. The datasheet for an RGB LED will tell you the **forward current** and **forward voltage** for each colour on the LED, to help you calculate the resistor needed, although it is often easier just to use a fairly high value resistor on each of the legs, such as a 220Î©.

You can prepare your RGB LEDs ready to use in projects:

Here is how you could wire an RGB LED to a Raspberry Pi Pico.

Set up your RGB LED in your code:

RGB colours can be given using three numbers from 0-255, `(255, 0, 255)` is purple (maximum red and maximum blue). You may need to adjust the colours depending on how bright each of the three colours is for your LED.

This code makes the LED change between different colours:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 
---
from picozero import RGBLED
from time import sleep

rgb = RGBLED(red = 1, green = 2, blue = 3)

while True:
    rgb.color = (255, 0, 0)
    sleep(0.5)
    rgb.color = (0, 255, 0)
    sleep(0.5)
    rgb.color = (0, 0, 255)
    sleep(0.5)

You can also use `blink`, `pulse` and `cycle` to create colour effects:
