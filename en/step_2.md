## Meet Raspberry Pi Pico

This is a Raspberry Pi Pico. Hopefully your device has already had the header pins soldered on, but if not, you might like to have a look at our [Getting started with soldering resource](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-soldering).

A Raspberry Pi Pico has 40 pins on its board. Pins allow you to connect external components to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

If you need to know the pin numbers for a Raspberry Pi Pico, you can refer to the following diagram that shows the underneath side of the Raspberry Pi Pico.

The [Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro) path uses jumper wires to connect electronic component directly to the Raspberry Pi Pico, with resistors as needed.
